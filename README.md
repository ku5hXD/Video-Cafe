This is a *video sharing* website, which is built using tech stack like ***React JS*** for frontend, ***Node*** for backend, and is using [***Mongo DB***](https://www.mongodb.com/) for it's database.

The twist here is that, the video uploaded on this website are stored in [***IPFS***](https://ipfs.io/), that stands for The ***InterPlanetary File System*** which is a protocol and ***peer-to-peer*** network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.
